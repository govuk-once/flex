# @flex/vitest-config

This package provides a shared Vitest configuration for projects within this monorepo.

Its purpose is to standardize test setup, reporters, environment, and other Vitest options across projects, while still allowing individual projects to extend or customize their test configuration.

All projects in this monorepo are expected to consume these configs rather than defining their own Vitest config.
